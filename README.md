# Python-Password-Generator
Generated an Encrypted Password for User Automatically using List Iteration and For Loops

I have gone for the easy version as well as the hard/ strong password version where the python code will generate a user 
password in sequence. So for example, if the user wanted four letters,two symbols and two numbers, then it might just look like (khdf$#79).
this four letters and then two symbols and then two numbers.

So they're in sequence. First, you've got the letters, then you've got the number of required symbols, and then you've got the required numbers.
And then there is the hard level. And the hard level requires you to generate the password in a completely random order.

So instead of having it being, letter symbol number,it should be maybe letter and then a symbol and then a number,then a letter, then a symbol and then a number.
SOmething like(fd#7$hk9)
